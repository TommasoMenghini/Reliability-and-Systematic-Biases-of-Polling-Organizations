# Polling Error Analysis

In this document the polling error analysis is carried out. Specifically, the first objective is to investigate the presence of systematic biases in the forecasts of voters' intentions provided by polling agencies for each selected party and election. The second objective is to assess the precision of the agencies' forecasts, with a particular focus on whether some agencies are more reliable than others. The analysis closely mirrors the implementation in the R script [error_analysis.R](R/error_analysis.R).

> **Prerequisite**  
> This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the introductory framework outlined in [intro.md](intro.md) and in [filter.md](filter.md).
